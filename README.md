# **Introduction:**
IamSnaky is a simple snake game written in JAVA.  
Snaky can now do all the things like from eating the food to dying.  
Though some bugs need to be fixed but apart from those it's playable.  

# **Rules of IamSnaky:**  
Just like any othe snake games like:
1. Snaky is hungry and needs to eat the food. Use the arrow keys to move Snaky and direct it to its food.
2. When Snaky eats the foods it increases its length by one block and that increases the score by 10 (Which initiates with 0).
3. If Snaky hits any one of the walls it comes from just its opposite.
4. If Snaky hits its own body it dies and game overs.
5. To pause the game just hit `Enter` and to run again just hit any of the arrows.
6. For closing just click the `x` on the top right.

# **Running:**  
* To run the game first clone it to a specific location by:  
`git clone git@github.com:programoworm/IamSnaky.git` or simply download the zip from the location and extract.  
* Then change the directory to IamSnaky by:
